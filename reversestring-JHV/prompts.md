**Tool**: ChatGPT

1. Basic Prompt with basic instruction

**Goal**: Create the most basic version with a simple request
```
Create a web page with JavaScript logic that reverses the order of a string.
Example: if I input AI4Devs, it should return sveD4IA.
Do it using the seed files index.html and script.js (file is empty not provided just as reference) provided 
```

2. Improve UI and add new features

**Goal**: Improve the style of the HTML (just for fun) and introduce new features, validation of 3 letters and real time reverse.
